TP = confusion[1, 1]
TN = confusion[0, 0]
FP = confusion[0, 1]
FN = confusion[1, 0]
"Classifier accuracy is: " (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

sensitivity = TP / (FN + TP)

false_negative_rate = FN / ( FN + TP)

specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

false_positive_rate = FP / float(TN + FP)


The precision is the ratio tp / (tp + fp) where tp is the number of true positives and fp the number of false positives. The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative.
